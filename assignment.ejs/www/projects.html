		<h3> Nausicaa </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/project1.jpg" alt="knitted sweater and yarn">
		This cropped sweater was such a quick knit and it only uses 1 skein of fingering weight yarn for the smaller sizes. It is worked top down using raglan increases and shaped with short rows. Iused a colourway called Seaside which I dyed especially for the Yarnfolk Festival of Yarn in 2019.This is a very light sweater, suitable for wearing with jeans or over a dress or tunic.

		The <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/nausicaa-3">pattern</a> is designed by Audrey Borrego, a knitwear designer from the south west of France.

		<h3> Oslo Hat </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/project2.jpg" alt="knitted hat and yarn">
		This is a super cosy hat and enjoyable to knit too.
		It is knit in a dk weight yarn, or 2 strands of fingering weight yarn held together. It is knit in one continuous tube, then folded before adding the brim. I used a non superwash yarn in colourways Nightfall and Winnie. 
		<br>
		The <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-oslo-hat">pattern</a> is designed by Mette, a creative entrepreneur designing under the brand PetiteKnit.

		<h3> Simple Something </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/project3.jpg" alt="unfinished knitted rainbow sweater">
		At the start of March 2020, I was searching for a new project and I had a box of leftover fingering weight yarns from numerous other projects. I decided on a colourful sweater. After sorting through the leftover box I realised (in true fashion) that I could make a rainbow sweater! I loved knitting every stitch of this sweater. I can remember sitting in my back garden knitting, the sun was shining and my kids played in the background.
