	<h2> Favourites </h2>
	<p>
		This is a place to log the projects I really want to make but haven't started yet. I could make a list as long as my arm but instead I will share just my favourites with you. 2021 for me, is the year of the sweater!
		What are your dream projects?

		<h3> Durumi </h3>

		<br>
		I first saw this pattern on the cover of Pom Pom Magazine and fell in love with it. I plan on making it with a darker navy colour for the main body with something bring for the triangle colourwork. It's on my list and I hope to get to it soon!!

		<h3> Lizzie Sweater </h3>

		<br>
		Just look at the colours in this beautiful sweater. It is mostly colours that draw me to patterns. I have not decided what colours I will use for my very own Lizzie sweater but I just know I HAVE to have one.

		<h3> Felix Pullover </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/felix.jpg" alt="knitted sweater" />
		<br>
		I love this sweater for two reasons. The first is it simplicity, there is nothing I like more than a relaxing project. But it's the detail that makes a project like this more interesting and difficult to put down. The shoulder detail here is just beautiful. I am really looking forward to casting this on!
