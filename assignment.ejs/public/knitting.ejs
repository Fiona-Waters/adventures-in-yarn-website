		<h3> The Ola Yoke Sweater. </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/ola.jpg" alt="knitted sweater"/>
		This sweater was my first attempt at colour-work and it was a fun and interesting challenge. It is worked top down using raglan increases and shaped with short rows. I decided to use rainbow mini skeins in order for the colour-work and a blue shade called Cosmos for the body and sleeves. The finished blocked sweater has a great fit and as it is knit in fingering weight yarn it is nice and light but still warm.

		<h3> Galdur </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/galdur.jpg" alt="knitted hat"/>
		This hat was my second attempt at colour-work knitting. I used the leftovers from a set of rainbow mini skeins which I originally used for the Ola Yoke Sweater, along with a dark grey with black speckles. This pattern starts with the bottom ribbing and works its way up using a chart for the colour-work pattern. It is a simple yet beautiful make. A great addition to anyone's autumn wardrobe!

		<h3> Simple Yet Effective Cowl </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/simple.jpg" alt="knitted cowl" />
		This knit was exactly as described in its name! It was very simple to knit using only knit and purl stitches in the round yet it makes for an interesting (effective!!) finished object. Knit using DK weight yarn in shades of grey with orange flecks which was aptly named ‘charcoal’, it makes for a super cosy winter neck warmer.
