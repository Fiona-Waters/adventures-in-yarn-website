		<h3> Erigeneia Shawl</h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/erigeneia.jpg" alt="rainbow crochet shawl" />
		This pattern allowed use of a gradient perfectly, for which I used a rainbow gradient. With 50g per colour I had loads for a fairly large shawl. Crocheted in fingering weight, it was not the quickest of projects but the finished object has a lovely drape and enough bulk to keep you warm on a cold Winter day. Perfect for a beginner or more advanced crocheter alike.

		<h3> Flora Shawl </h3>
		<img class="main-img" src="images/flora.jpg" alt="crochet shawl" />
		This project is a quick and simple one, using just one skein of fingering weight yarn in whatever colour tickles your fancy. Pictured is a variegated hand dyed yarn in shades of green and blue, named Earth. The pattern is a 12 row repeat which makes for some relaxing and soothing making. A nice light addition to your spring/summer wardrobe.

		<h3> Faded Blooms </h3> 
		<img class="main-img" src="images/fadedblooms.jpg" alt="crochet shawl" />
		Another pattern by the Irish designer, this one is more suited to an intermediate level crocheter. This pattern uses 2 skeins of fingering weight yarn in contrasting colours to bring out the beautiful floral inspired lace. Add tassels for a bit of fun!
